                    <!-- Looking forward into the process of my master’s thesis,  -->
                    Some useful information has presented itself about achieving realistic lighting. Sketchfab, in its current state, only happens
                    to support up to three real-time lights, along with image based lighting. The reason behind this limitation
                    is to reduce the number of draw-calls generated by having an abundance of dynamic light sources within
                    a scene. This enables Sketchfab to run smoothly on any number of lower-end devices such as mobile phones
                    and previous generation PC’s.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The way that Sketchfab calculates real-time lighting is by generating a depth map of the geometry from the view of each light
                    source within the scene. This means that Sketchfab needs to calculate up to three depth maps per scene
                    per frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For animated scenes, this can mean large amounts of calculations that could potentially slow down a computer attempting to
                    view the scene. Hence, Sketchfab’s restriction to allow a maximum of three light sources per scene. This
                    is, by far, a more viable means of lighting real-time 3D geometry as opposed to ray tracing, which hasn’t
                    quite reached real-time viability, although rumor has it that AI learning and cloud computing may soon
                    push those boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, there’s something to be considered about the method of using depth maps to calculate lighting. It’s very limited.
                    According to the staff at Sketchfab, the depth maps that are used to create lighting have a resolution
                    of 1024 pixels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This size is more than sufficient for smaller scenes with the intention of presenting up to a few objects, however on larger,
                    more complex scenes it tends to produce artifacts akin to pixelation. Although Sketchfab allows users
                    to tweak the way the depth maps are interpreted using anti-aliasing and a shadow bias control to avoid
                    artifacts, it is still very limited in that this control is most effectively utilized in a small scene
                    where a 1024 px. map is to appropriate scale.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Fortunately, Sketchfab allows users to upload a custom light map prior to scene assembly.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the shadows generated by using certain types of lighting are often harsher than a scene’s ambiance may demand,
                    especially given a larger scene. For example, the directional lights in Sketchfab seem to produce very
                    sharp shadows that do not have a believable falloff. To remedy this, a user may choose to switch to spot
                    or point lighting which both come with a falloff control and a softness option, but again, tend to produce
                    artifacts in larger scenes.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Moreover, three lights may be useful for some unique and powerful three-point lighting scenarios, but the limitation leaves
                    something to be desired when attempting to present a scene with more complicated lighting. In all fairness,
                    it is worth noting that the lighting setups in Sketchfab do work very well given an appropriate scene
                    size. The anti-aliasing feature also makes even medium sized scenes viable with decent lighting. It is
                    for the specific purpose of exploring larger, more wholly conceptual scenes comprised of multiple characters
                    and environmental assets that the default lighting setup does not support well. Herein lies the conflict
                    between this project and Sketchfab’s limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, Sketchfab allows users to upload a custom light map prior to scene assembly. This allows users to have as many
                    lights as desired and baked by whichever method of calculating lighting the user chooses, including ray
                    tracing, and at any resolution up to 8K.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to long load times, it’s not practical to use maps beyond a 2K resolution, but it sure is a welcome option to have so
                    much control over scene lighting. The only other issue regarding light map baking has often been the
                    tedium of baking the maps. Fortunately, with access to Otoy’s Octane Render, it’s easier than ever to
                    very quickly bake out light maps on a per object basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The utility of Octane lies in how well it handles realistic lighting and the Octane native baking camera makes short work
                    of creating the maps, provided that the object UV’s have been laid out before baking. The following scenes
                    are examples using baked lighting to achieve believable lighting in Sketchfab that makes use of soft
                    lighting from a multitude of sources.</p>

                <p>
                    The above scene makes use of eight baked lights (warm light left, green light right, and six cold lights, each attached to
                    lamp posts) that control the amount of light that is emitted into the scene. It’s also worth noting
                    that each light has a soft falloff that helps give the scene atmosphere.
